# Relevancy

* Scoring basics: clauses are added in conjunction with the score parameter
* Boost by field value or function thereof
* TF/IDF, BM25
* compound: additive clause scoring
* scoreDetails w/ demonstrative lab
* The key to solid relevancy - match lots of ways, let the best and most matched docs bubble to the top

## Retrieving score and scoreDetails
* $addFields `searchScore`
* $project `scoreDetails`

* `"scoreDetails": true` to get `searchScoreDetails`
