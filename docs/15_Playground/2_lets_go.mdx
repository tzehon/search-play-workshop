# üëê Our first playground exercise

1. Navigate to this Playground snapshot: 
   https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/6782aea0667feaaf06324b87
2. Press "Run" (TODO: bring in the Run graphic)
3. Notice the empty `[]` results

The objective with this exercise is to adjust the `FIX_ME` in the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage so that the document (in the Data Source pane) matches the query and appears in the Results pane.
