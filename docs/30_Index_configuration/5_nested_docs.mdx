# 📘 Nested documents

A document can contain a nested document, or an array of them.

There are two distinct ways to map and index the contents of nested documents.

## `document`

Default dynamic mapping behavior, flattens nested documents into “arrays” of values on main document

## `embeddedDocuments`

Attribute pattern `elemMatch`-like matching, more nuanced and expensive than document type flattening

WARNING: Each nested document mapped as as `embeddedDocuments` counts as an additional "index object".
