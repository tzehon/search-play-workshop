# 📘 String fields

## String-focused workshop

Most data types are queried straightforwardly, and match as one would expect.
We'll survey non-string types in the next section, however we primarily focus on `string` fields,
as that's where the power of Atlas Search shines.

### autocomplete
blah, don’t do it! ;)

## string
Basic examples
lucene.standard matching case-insensitive: https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/664738af4e0a3f240a5de9d9

## Analysis matters
“searches” query does not match “Search” with lucene.standard: https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/664739964e0a3f240a5de9db
“searches” matches “Search” using lucene.english: https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/66473aa64e0a3f240a5de9dd

## Custom analyzers
Last 4 digit of phone number matching (regex extraction during indexing, keyword analysis at query time): https://search-playground.corp.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/669e6c98d49ef6fad98118ba
Example of being able to do ‘startsWith’ and ‘endsWith’ using wildcard and ‘reverse’ token filter:

Example of being able to do ‘startsWith’, ‘endsWith’ and ‘contains’ using nGrams: https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/6683c999934a05d9b585b6e7 
Relevancy
Example of an as-you-type suggest configuration; sophisticated use of multi and several weighted query clauses: https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-playground/snapshots/66473b744e0a3f240a5de9e1

# multi
Why?
Relevancy example: boost each multi uniquely
Multiple language example: may not know the language of the content and each document could be different - multi across all possible languages, query across them as desired at query-time, let relevancy sort it out
