# ðŸ“˜ String fields

Most data types are queried straightforwardly, and match as one would expect with standard
MongoDB B-Tree indexes. However, `string` fields are exceptional, in many ways. 

There are several ways in which strings can be used:

  * Matching exact (or case-insensitive) values. Good ol' `equals` and `in`
  * To search for words, or variations thereof, within a string
  * Partial, or sub-string, matching
  * For sorting
  * Faceting (not covered in this workshop)
  * Highlighting (not covered in this workshop)

A BSON `string` field in your collection can be mapped into one or more of the string-supporting Atlas Search types. A `dynamic: true` mapping maps all `string` field in one way: as full-text fields analyzed with `lucene.standard`. This analyzed textual field type is called `string`. An Atlas Search field indexed as string can only be queried by certain operators meant for full text queries. However, let's first cover the most basic way a string field can be indexed and used: as-is. In order to index a string field as it's exact or normalized value and make use of `equals` and `in` operators to query it as the exact or normalized value, it must be statically mapped to type `token`.

## `token`

A `token` type mapping indexes strings as-is (or normalized) in a way suitable for full string `equals`
and `in` matching, as well as for `$search.sort`'ing

## `autocomplete`

This field type is paired with an operator by the same name to provide partial, sub-string, matching.

Careful though - while this field type sounds alluring and does match sub-strings, it does not by
itself provide good relevancy or highlighting and can explode the index size.

The `autocomplete` field type and operator use complex analysis and querying technique build upon the Analysis techniques in the next section and will be covered a bit more there.

## `string`

The heart of Lucene - text!  `string` mapped fields are analyzed so that its individual terms are
searchable.
