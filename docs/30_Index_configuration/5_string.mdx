# ðŸ“˜ String fields

## String-focused workshop

Most data types are queried straightforwardly, and match as one would expect.
We'll survey non-string types in the next section, however we primarily focus on `string` fields,
as that's where the power of Atlas Search shines.

### autocomplete
blah, donâ€™t do it! ;)

Query operators:
text: matches any of the query terms; can include synonyms and fuzziness
phrase: matches query terms that occur in proximity
regex: pattern matching
wildcard: matches across missing characters
moreLikeThis: matches documents that overlap important terms
Analysis occurs on query values
Except on regex and wildcard operators: partial strings not analyzable
Index-time and search-time analyzers can be different, if needed
Remember: itâ€™s a dictionary
Index it how youâ€™d like to find it; search for it how you indexed it
Leverage analyzers to index text efficiently for searching
Index statistics factor into score computations
