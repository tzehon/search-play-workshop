# Exercises: Type mismatches

Atlas Search is quite type sensitive. The BSON type of each field is used to determine which index mapping type to use. And at query time, the search operator type of the `value` is used to determine which indexed type to query for a particular field/path name.

## boolean

<Playground url="https://search-playground.corp.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/67962dfdaa132ffc76719f57">ðŸ”— Playground link: boolean type mismatch</Playground>

Why doesn't this playground match as expected?

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
<div>
The type of `$search.equals.value` is not an actual boolean (it's a `string` of "true") and thus will be looking for an indexed value corresponding that type (which in this case would be a `token` field type).

Here's a corrected pipeline:
```js
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      equals: {
        value: true,
        path: "in_stock"
      }
    }
  }
]
```
</div>

## number

Why won't the query match?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <div>
  The value must be a number, not a string.

  ```js
  value: 10.99
  ```
  </div>
</details>


## ObjectID

The ObjectId value is correct, but the document does not match. Can you spot, and fix, the issue?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <div>
  The value must be an ObjectId, not a string.

  ```js
  value: ObjectId("5a9427648b0beebeb69589a1")
  ```
  </div>
