# Exercises: Type mismatches

Atlas Search is quite type sensitive. The BSON type of each field is used to determine which index mapping type to use. And at query time, the type of `value` or `query` is used to determine which index to query for a particular field/path name.

Why don't this playground match as expected?

  Because $search.equals.value is a string of "true", not an actual boolean. 
  Here's a corrected pipeline:
  ```js
  [
    {
      $search: {
        index: "default",
        equals: {
          value: true,
          path: "in_stock"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
