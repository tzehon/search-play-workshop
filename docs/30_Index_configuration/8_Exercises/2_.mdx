# Exercises: Type mismatches

Atlas Search is quite type sensitive. The BSON type of each field is used to determine which index mapping type to use. And at query time, the type of `value` or `query` is used to determine which index to query for a particular field/path name.

## boolean
Why doesn't this playground match as expected?

  The type of `$search.equals.value` is not an actual boolean (it's a `string` of "true") and thus will be looking for an indexed value corresponding that type (which in this case would be a `token` search type).

  Here's a corrected pipeline:
  ```js
  [
    {
      $search: {
        index: "default",
        equals: {
          value: true,
          path: "in_stock"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
