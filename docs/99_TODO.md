* Remove "corp" from all Playground links
* Fire up ProcessCene and generate some analysis images, etc
* Polish headers/footers
* Fix publishing to GH Pages (need @pash to set me as owner)
* should completed/solved playgrounds be saved and linked in here as well?
* Add coverage of "index objects" counting
* Add transition verbiage at the end of each page/section to lead into the next one
* should all links back to mongodb.com have UTMs?  How to use the variables?
   - research
* border around images?  click to make them larger?
   - see docs!
