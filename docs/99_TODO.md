## Issues
  * Add coverage of "index objects" counting
  * fix the duplicate route warning (see change to config file to ignore)

## Questions
  * should completed/solved playgrounds be saved and linked in here as well?
  * should all links back to mongodb.com have UTMs?  How to use the variables?

## Content
  * Remove "corp" from all Playground links
  * Fire up ProcessCene and generate some analysis images, etc
  * Add transition verbiage at the end of each page/section to lead into the next one
  * Ensure `index` parameter is on all $search/$searchMeta
  * Update TOC in welcome section to reflect actual
  * Make a slide deck
