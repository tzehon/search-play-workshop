## Only make searchable a specific subset of fields

Make it so only fields under the `metadata` structure are indexed (and thus this query would then fail to find any matching documents). This is an exercise where no matching documents (an empty array `[]`) is the goal, rather than matching on a field that should not be indexed.

    Turn off top-level dynamic mapping, and only index the `metadata` sub-structure.
    ```js
    {
      "mappings": {
        "dynamic": false,
        "fields": {
          "metadata": [
            {
              "type": "document",
              "dynamic": true
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
