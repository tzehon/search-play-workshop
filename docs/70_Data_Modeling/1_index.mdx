## Techniques

### consistent field types

Schema matters!  A `price` is a number, never a `string`!!

### Nested documents

Avoid `embeddedDocuments` when:
* There's only one field in them
* Matching on a flattened structure suffices

## Entity pattern
  * Labs: movies search searching for movies, versus searching for cast members
  * Tips: $merge
