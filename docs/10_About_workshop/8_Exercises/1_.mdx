# Exercise: Fix me

Here's a gentle first exercise to get us started with the playground.
You'll see an index configuration and an aggregation pipeline stage that
hasn't been introduced yet, but no worries - 
we'll get there next. See if you can solve it with what you already know or expect.

We're going to work through this one together as a group.

1. Navigate to the Playground snapshot linked below.
2. Press "Run"
3. Notice the empty array `[]` of results

The objective with this exercise is to adjust the `FIX_ME` in the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage so that the document (in the Data Source pane) matches the query and appears in the Results pane.

  You can copy this pipeline and paste it in to the playground's Query panel and press Run.
  ```js
  [
    {
      $search: {
        index: "default",
        text: {
          query: "search",
          path: "title"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  </div>

  <div>
  `atlas` or `fundamentals` or other case variations of any `title` field words
