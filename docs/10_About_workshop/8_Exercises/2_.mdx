# Your own playground

Create a <Playground url="https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/new">ðŸ”— Playground link: new playground</Playground>.

Clear the data box in the lower left (select-all, delete), and then type, paste, or import an array of a few documents. You could copy/paste the below, for example:

```
[
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "title": "mY vErY fIrSt PlAyGrOuNd"
  }
]
```

Now, in the upper left box, create an aggregation pipeline that uses `$search` as the first (and only, for now)
stage. Here's one that matches that document with the default configuration: 

```
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      text: {
        query: "my playground",
        path: "title"
      }
    }
  }
]
  ```
Press Run!

## Your playground, your data

At this point, experiment for a moment - click around, adjust the data to something of interest and
see if you can get a `$search` query to match. 

It's meant to break, without breaking anything else. What happened? Was there an error message or unexpected empty `[]` results? No worries.
