# üëê Our first playground exercise

Here's a gentle first exercise to get you started with the playground. You'll see an index configuration and an aggregation pipeline stage that hasn't been introduced yet, but no worries - 
we'll get there next. See if you can solve it with what you already know or expect.

1. Navigate to this Playground snapshot: 
   https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/6782aea0667feaaf06324b87
2. Press "Run"
3. Notice the empty `[]` results

The objective with this exercise is to adjust the `FIX_ME` in the `$search` aggregation pipeline stage so that the document (in the Data Source pane) matches the query and appears in the Results pane.

<div>
You can copy this pipeline and paste it in to the playground's Query panel and press Run.
```js
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      text: {
        query: "search",
        path: "title"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

<summary>There are other possible solutions too, such as:</summary>
<div>
`atlas` or `fundamentals` or other case variations of any `title` field words
