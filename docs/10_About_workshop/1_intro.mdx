# ðŸ“˜ Atlas Search Playground

The Atlas Search Playground (or just Playground) is used for the exercises in this workshop.
The Playground is a self-contained lightweight, yet feature-rich Atlas Search environment
which does not require an Atlas account to use.

There are two tools in the Playground:
  * `Code Sandbox`: your data, an index configuration, an aggregation pipeline, and results
  * `Search Demo Builder`: a configurable search UI on your data

The exercises will only use the Code Sandbox, as it allows saving and sharing links to
the full environment and allows us to work on one topic at a time.

We'll cover the Search Demo Builder briefly near the end of the workshop.

## Code Sandbox layout

To begin, navigate to the [Atlas Search Playground](https://search-playground.mongodb.com/).
In the next section, you'll work through the first exercise to get familiar with the
Playground's Code Sandbox.

Let's dive into the world of Atlas Search using this convenient and powerful playground!
