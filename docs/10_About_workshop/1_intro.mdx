# ðŸ“˜ Atlas Search Playground

> I really like use of the Search playground. Itâ€™s fun to play with,
> makes me feel good that I can figure out the answer,
> and encourages me to tinker.

The Atlas Search Playground (or just Playground) is used for the exercises in this workshop.
The Playground is a self-contained lightweight, yet feature-rich Atlas Search environment
which does not require an Atlas account to use.

There are two tools in the Playground:
  * `Code Sandbox`: your data, an index configuration, an aggregation pipeline, and results
  * `Search Demo Builder`: a configurable search UI on your data

The exercises will only use the Code Sandbox, as it allows saving and sharing links to
the full environment and allows us to work on one topic at a time.

We'll cover the Search Demo Builder briefly near the end of the workshop.

## Code Sandbox layout

To begin, navigate to the [Atlas Search Playground](https://search-playground.mongodb.com/).
In the next section, you'll work through the first exercise to get familiar with the
Playground's Code Sandbox.

### Run button

After you make changes to any of the Playground areas, press the `Run` button to execute
the aggregation pipeline.

### Comments

In the QUERY pane, lines prefixed with `//` comment-out the line. This is a useful way to document your work, or to have some variations to play around with.

The DATA SOURCE pane also accepts the comment prefix.

### Error messages

Sometimes aren't related to the actual cause. Syntax errors can cause confusion in interpreting the pipeline, configuration, or data.

Step back with a leaner, cleaner working example and build back up carefully.

This is why a Playground is useful - mistakes andtypos happen. syntax is unforgiving.
Error messages are our friend, giving us an opportunity to fix and learn iteratively in a safe environment.
