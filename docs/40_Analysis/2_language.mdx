你好！Bom dia! Hola!

Language challenges: word breaks, punctuation, stemming, diacritics, case

## Mixed languages

Scenarios:
  * One field, but each document could be a different language, or multiple languages
    mixed into a single value. or 
  * Language-specific fields (title_en, title_zh... `title.zh`/`title.en`): map language-specific fields
    in the config to language-specific analyzers
  * Documents segregated by language: separate collections each with appropriate analysis

## Exercises

  * lucene.standard => lucene.english to get a "searched" query to match "search"
    * Likewise Portuguese stemming example
  * Chinese analysis
