Language challenges: word breaks, punctuation, stemming, diacritics, case

## Stemming

Stemming is a process that reduces a word to a common representation so that it can match
with words from the same root form. For example, words like "search", "searches", "searched", and
"searching" would be stemmed (using an English language stemmer) down to just "search".

The stem is not necessarily a real word. For example, the words "country" and "countries" would 
stem to "countri". The stems are generated during the indexing process, and also during querying.

## Mixed languages

Scenarios:
  * One field, but each document could be a different language, or multiple languages
    mixed into a single value. or 
  * Language-specific fields (title_en, title_zh... `title.zh`/`title.en`): map language-specific fields
    in the config to language-specific analyzers
  * Documents segregated by language: separate collections each with appropriate analysis configured
