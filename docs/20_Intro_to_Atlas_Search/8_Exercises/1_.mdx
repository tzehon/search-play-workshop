# Exercise: search pipeline stages

<Playground url="https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/6782aea0667feaaf06324b87">$search => $searchMeta</Playground>

# Step 1
  1. Navigate to the original Playground used in the last section's exercise     
  2. Press Run. Got the empty `[]` array of results?
  3. Change `$search` to `$searchMeta` (in the Query pane), and press Run again.

  <details>
  <summary>Here's the expected results...</summary>
  <div>
  ```js
  [
    {
      "count": {
        "lowerBound": 0
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  </div>
  </details>

# Step 2

  1. Now fix the query to match the document as you did previously
  2. Press Run again
  3. Did the `$searchMeta` results change?

  <details>
  <summary>Here's the expected results...</summary>
  <div>
  ```js
  [
    {
      "count": {
        "lowerBound": 1
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  </div>
  </details>

  IMPORTANT: Always specify the `index` parameter. Otherwise it uses `default`(?) and if there's no
             index by that name, you get `[]` not an error. The Playground only has a `default`-named index. (and you get an error if you use any other name); be explicit.
