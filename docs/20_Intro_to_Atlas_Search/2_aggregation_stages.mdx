# ðŸ“˜ Aggregation pipeline search stages

The search stages must be the first stage in a pipeline, as they do not accept incoming
documents but rather only emit documents. There are two stages available, depending on 
the particular needs. 

* `index` name parameter: good idea to be explicit about it, otherwise `default`.

## $search

Returns matching documents.

Search metadata (count and facets) are available via the $$SEARCH_META aggregation variable.
Results are returned in descending **score** order or in an optional `sort` order.

## $searchMeta

Returns a single document of search result metadata including count of matching documents
and any facets requested. No actual collection documents are returned.

The `$searchMeta` stage performs the same search that `$search` does,
but only returns the results metadata, not actual matching documents.
Results metadata includes the count of matching results and facets.
This same metadata is available when using `$search` too, 
accessible in the $$SEARCH_META context variable.

## Post $search-stages

  * Such as $sort, $group, etc any stage that consumes **all** documents from previous stage.
  * $limit, $addFields, $project and the like are fine as they only operate on one doc at a time
    or cut-off
