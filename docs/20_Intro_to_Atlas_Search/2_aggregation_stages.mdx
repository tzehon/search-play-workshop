# üëê Aggregation pipeline search stages

## $search

Returns matching documents.

Search metadata (count and facets) are available via the $$SEARCH_META aggregation variable.
Results are returned in descending **score** order or in an optional `sort` order.

## $searchMeta

Returns a single document of search result metadata including count of matching documents
and facets requested. No actual collection documents are returned.

The `$searchMeta` stage performs the same search that `$search` does,
but only returns the results metadata, not actual matching documents.
Results metadata includes the count of matching results and facets.
This same metadata is available when using `$search` too, 
accessible in the $$SEARCH_META context variable.



## Exercises: search pipeline stages

### Step 1
1. Navigate to the original Playground used in the last section's exercise
   https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/6782aea0667feaaf06324b87
2. Press Run. Got the empty `[]` array of results?
3. Change `$search` to `$searchMeta` (in the Query pane), and press Run again.

<details>
<summary>Here's the expected results...</summary>
<div>
```js
[
  {
    "count": {
      "lowerBound": 0
    }
  }
]
```
</div>
</details>

### Step 2

1. Now fix the query to match the document as you did previously
2. Press Run again
3. Did the `$searchMeta` results change?

<details>
<summary>Here's the expected results...</summary>
<div>
```js
[
  {
    "count": {
      "lowerBound": 1
    }
  }
]
```
</div>
</details>

## Post $search-stages

  * Such as $sort, $group, etc any stage that consumes **all** documents from previous stage.
  * $limit, $addFields, $project and the like are fine as they only operate on one doc at a time
    or cut-off
