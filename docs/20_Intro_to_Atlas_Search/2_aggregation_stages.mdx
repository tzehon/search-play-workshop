# Aggregation pipeline search stages

## $search

where the magic happens

## $searchMeta

The `$searchMeta` stage performs the same search that `$search` does, but only returns the results metadata, not actual matching documents. Results metadata includes the count of matching results and facets. This same metadata is available when using `$search` too, accessible in the $$SEARCH_META context variable.

**TODO**: Add exercise using $search and have developer switch to $searchMeta to see the results
