## Anatomy of a Lucene index

A Lucene index encapsulates specialized data structures unique to each type of data indexed.

  * Numbers and dates: ...
  * Geo-spatial: ...
  * Text: via inverted indexes

Each field is indexed independently.

Segmented architecture, append-only, for fast indexing. Background processes to optimize the index
segments.
