# ðŸ“˜ Atlas Search architecture

Atlas Search provides powerful findability capabilities to your data collections. A flexible index configuration allows mapping and indexing only the fields needed, or dynamically mapping any and all fields supported.

Changes to a collection via updates, deletes, or additions are *eventually consistent*, meaning the
index is updated independently of changes to the collection in a separate process, asynchronously. The lag between a change made to the database and refelected in a subsequent search is dependent on many factors such as deployment tier and architecture, the complexity of the index mapping, the other changes that are also queued, and the laws of physics.

The Atlas Search process can be deployed either coupled alongside the database nodes, or on separate dedicated nodes. Dedicated nodes provide separation of concerns, alleviating resource contention. Dedicated search nodes are recommended for production workloads.
