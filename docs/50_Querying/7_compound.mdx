# ðŸ“˜ `compound` operator

The `compound` is a meta-query operator that serves to combine other search operators to form
more sophisticated queries, enabling optional and mandatory clauses, excluding clauses, and allowing clauses to match documents without affecting their relevancy score.

A compound operator could be used, for example, to filter for products within the "Toys" category that
must match the term "lego" (or "legos") in the product description, must not cost greater than $100, and optionally match the products that are `used` (`pre_owned` == false) increasing the relevancy of new (not pre_owned) products.

`minimumShouldMatch`

The key to solid relevancy - match lots of ways, let the best and most matched docs bubble to the top
