# ðŸ“˜ Wildcard and Regex queries

Both of these operators share ...

## Analyzer considerations

Analyzer determines what is matchable. 
`lucene.keyword` to match across the entire string.
Any other analyzer to match across the pieces of
its output.

Static prefix matters: index scan, or only prefix-matching slice scanned.

## `wildcard`

The `wildcard` operator supports two *wildcard* characters, `?` and `*` which can be placed anywhere
in the query string, one or more of them. 

* `?`: Matches any single character
* `*`: Matches zero or more characters

## `regex`

The `regex` operator supports a robust regular expression syntax, able to match sophisticated patterns against the terms of an inverted index.
