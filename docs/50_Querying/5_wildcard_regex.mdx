# ðŸ“˜ Wildcard and Regex queries

There are two similar operators that perform pattern matching: `wildcard` and `regex`.

## Analyzer considerations

The analyzer determines what is matchable. 
`lucene.keyword` to match across the entire string.
Any other analyzer to match across the pieces of its output.

Static prefix matters: index scan, or only prefix-matching slice scanned.

## `wildcard`

The `wildcard` operator supports only two *wildcard* characters, `?` and `*` which can be placed anywhere in the query string, one or more of them. 

* `?`: Matches any single character
* `*`: Matches zero or more characters

This is a useful operator to match strings starting with a particular prefix, by adding `*` to the end.
For example, a wildcard expression of `ho*` would match "horse" and "house".

## `regex`

The `regex` operator supports a robust regular expression syntax, able to match sophisticated patterns against the terms of an inverted index.
