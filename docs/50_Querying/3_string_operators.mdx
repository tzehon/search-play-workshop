# ðŸ“˜ String operators

String fields are analyzed, with the resulting terms being indexed. Queries on string fields are searching the indexed terms, not necessarily the entire string. 

String operators analyze query text, just as field text is analyzed during index.

## `text`

To query for individual terms, or words, of a `string` field. 

If the `query` text analyzes to more than one term, the query either makes all terms optional (default) or all terms mandatory (`matchCriteria: "all"`).

### fuzzy matching

...

## `phrase`

The `phrase` operator matches a sequence of words, in proximity to one another.

### phrase slop

...

## synonyms
