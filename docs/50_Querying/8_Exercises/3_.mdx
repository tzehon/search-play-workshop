  ```js
  "analyzer": "lucene.standard"
  ```

## ``regex``

<Playground url="https://search-playground.corp.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/679caa71d0df60f0254e5d60">Full string regex not working as expected</Playground>
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <div>
  ```js
  "analyzer": "lucene.keyword"
  ```
  Matching needs to occur across the full string, and thus needs to be `lucene.keyword`
  analyzed so that the full string is indexed as a single unit.
