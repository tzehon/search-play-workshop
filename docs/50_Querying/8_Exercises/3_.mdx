# Exercises: `wildcard` and `regex`

## `wildcard`

<Playground url="https://search-playground.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/67d1e0cd20b1632e508742aa">words that starts-with not matching as expected</Playground>

  <div>
  ```js
  "analyzer": "lucene.standard"
  ```
  The matching needs to occur at the word level, and thus needs (non-keyword) tokenization.

  And `allowAnalyzedField: true` needs to be set, allowing searches when using a tokenizing analyzer.

## ``regex``

<Playground url="https://search-playground.corp.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/67d1dff6643f61797f19d319">Full string regex not working as expected</Playground>
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <div>
  ```js
  "analyzer": "lucene.keyword"
  ```
  Matching needs to occur across the full string, and thus needs to be `lucene.keyword`
  analyzed so that the full string is indexed as a single unit.
