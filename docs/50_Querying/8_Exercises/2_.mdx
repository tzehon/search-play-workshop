# Exercises: `phrase`

Phrases match terms in proximity to one another, either exact order with no words in the middle, or with the words not necessarily in order or with additional words interspersed. 

HINT: See the [`phrase` operator docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/phrase/) for these exercises.
