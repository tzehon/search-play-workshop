# Exercises: `phrase`

Phrases match terms in proximity to one another, either exact order with no words in the middle, or with the words not necessarily in order or with additional words interspersed. 

HINT: See the [`phrase` operator docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/phrase/) for these exercises.

    ```js
    "slop": 1

    If the query were adjusted <Playground url="https://search-playground.corp.mongodb.com/tools/code-sandbox/snapshots/679c9038d0df60f0254e5d47">this would match</Playground>

    But you can't adjust what the users query for, so the configuration or search operators need
    to be adjusted.

# TODO

There's another setting than "slop" which allows out of order. It looks like we need to add it to the exercise/solution
